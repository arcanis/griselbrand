## What is it?

Griselbrand is a companion library for [Clipanion](https://github.com/arcanis/clipanion). It lets you transparently run some commands of your CLI inside a daemon process, thus preserving the state between calls.

## Overview


Griselbrand is intended to be very simple to use. The main thing is to annotate the commands that need to be run within a daemon context. In the following example, calling the script will cause a counter to be printed on screen, incremented at each invocation thanks to the `daemon.register(execute)` wrapper:

```ts
import {Cli, Command} from 'clipanion';
import {Daemon}       from 'griselbrand';

const daemon = new Daemon({port: 6532});

let counter = 0;

const cli = Cli.from([
  ...daemon.getControlCommands(),
  class MyCommand extends Command {
    execute = daemon.register(async () => {
      this.context.stdout.write(`Counter: ${counter++}\n`);
    });
  },
]);

daemon.runExit(cli, process.argv.slice(2));
```

Adding the commands provided by `daemon.getControlCommands()` to your CLI is optional and will automatically expose CLI commands for `status`/`start`/`stop`/`restart`. You can also implement them yourself by calling the relevant functions from the `daemon` instance.
